  #Keep writing story

4/28/2020 2:00 in the evening with beer, Total Time 15:00
  -Debated on drop tables
  -Started building chance table for skill succession
  -Thoughtout process of confidence and success chance.
  -Not too much progress
  -Much under-utilizied time

4/29/2020 2:30 dedicated like 4 with distractions TOTAL TIME: 18:00
  -Finished skill success table for T1-T5 skills
  -Refactored clicking skill buttons to check success rates
    -New script "Chance"
      -Functions to check skill success chance and then a good/bad drop table happens
  -Everything works! Built the project to phone and worked fine.

  FUTURE GOALS
  -Redesign layout, make it look better lol
  -Money? Deck power?
  #Descriptions (debug.log each action basically. maybe like a rolling text feed? ((twitch chat)))

4/30/2020 3ish, with much wasted time, TOTAL TIME 21:00
  -Added new layout for the main screen (temporary)
  -Had to do some really dumb shit to figure out new buttons
  -No more individual skill+action screen. Created 5 main screens and going to stick with that
  -Added two new scripts for tomorrow to work on (cutscenes and information section)

  FUTURE GOALS
  -Make first decsriptions (you failed this task, etc)
  #opening cutscene?? even if it is all just text, it's something
  -add all skills in and test each one
  #create options for actions based on scenarios????

5/4/2020 (small break cuz I suck) 2:00 TOTAL TIME 23:00
  -Refactored the checkProgress method, but need to do more work on it
  -I got it to stop the user from completing an action if there is a story thing about to occur
  -BUT I need to make a seperate method to get a bool and then something else to change the text
  -on the right track, just need to break it up into smaller pieces.
  -the more that happens the better off we will be.

  FUTURE GOALS
  -Fix progression. Top priority
  - nothing else. see goal #1.

5/5/2020 2:00 TOTAL TIME 25:00
  -Late morning sesh (2 hours)
    -kinda did what I needed to from the previous goal with seperating the progress check thing
    -it doesn't really work the way I need it to I guess
    -when I get back to it, I'm gonna work on writing out a diagram on how the actions menu is gonna work.
    -I think with a button sectioned off from the text it'll make it easier to seperate and create a better game flow.

    GOAL:
    -Actions diagram. Make this shit work.

5/7/2020 1:00 TOTAL TIME 26:00
  Pre-sesh notes:
    -Going to redesign today. Sick of looking at the black screen. Debating on switching to landscape but have not decided yet.

5/8/2020 3:00 Real progress for the first time. TOTAL TIME 29:00
  -Finalized colors and minor redesign.
    -Actual colors being used. Much easier on the eyes
  -Refactored state machine with enums. Much easier and cleaner
  -Changed bottom half of screen with the nice looking stuff.
    -Buttons that work when active and not active along with it's corresponding screen.
  -Made use of the actual UI system with the vert/hori components and parent/child relationships
    -clean

  GOALS:
  -Redo some of the storyboard stuff.
  -Change the time to an enum if needed (probably unneccesary)
  -Make sure the descriptions work with skills n shit, since I didn't check that yet.
    -I'm sure it's fine

5/11/2020 :30 Didn't do shit TOTAL TIME 29:30
  -played runescape more than I should have.
  -But i did figure out how I should do the drop rate thing
    -not completely but I learned about random.value so thats cool i guess

5/12/2020 :30 (not really a full hour but w/e) TOTAL TIME 30:00
  -started the process of onClick and running the chance of something happening.
  -with add event listener we can probs alter each click which could become messy

  GOAL:
  -CAN I IMPLEMENT A FORMULA WITH SKILLS/CONFIDENCE/Attributes
  -pls;
